### Hi! My name is Alessandro! ðŸ‘‹


I'm a M.Sc. Student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

I'm deeply interested in Data Science and Engineering and I'm currently the vice president of the student association Polimi Data Scientists (in short PMDS), we organize events with companies to bridge the gap between university students and the data science work market, and we also organize projects and workshops to give students the chance to do some hands on data science work.

I started coding in high school when I was 16, and over the course of the years I created and took part in a number of projects from many different fields, ranging from frontend and backend web development, going to augmented reality, data stream analytics and data pipelines modeling.  

Some of these project were done as part of my study curriculum, others just out of personal interest or as part of the PMDS projects team, here you can take a look at them (or at least the ones I was allowed to make public).
