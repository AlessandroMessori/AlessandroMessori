### Welcome to my Profile ðŸ‘‹


I'm a M.Sc. Student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

I'm mainly interested in Data Engineering and I'm currently a member of the student association Polimi Data Scientists.

Here you can take a look at the projects I've done over the years, some of them as part of my academic education, others out of personal interest.
