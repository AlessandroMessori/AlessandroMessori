<h2 align="center"> Summary</h2>
I'm currently working as a Software Data Engineer in the Apple Shazam Team in London.

<br/>

I'm deeply interested in Data Engineering and Distributed Systems, I'm always looking for new and interesting ways to efficiently collect, process and visualize huge quantities of data and extract powerful insights from them.

In the past, I was the vice president of the student association Polimi Data Scientists (in short PMDS), where I founded and kickstarted the projects section, a team that is now cooperating with multiple companies on several data-related projects.

I started coding in high school when I was 16, and over the course of the years, I created and took part in a number of projects from many different fields, ranging from frontend and backend web development, going to augmented reality, data stream analytics, and data pipelines modeling.  

Some of these projects were done as part of my study curriculum, others just out of personal interest or as part of the PMDS projects team, here you can take a look at them (or at least the ones I was allowed to make public).
