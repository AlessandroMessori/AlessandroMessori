### Hi! My name is Alessandro! ðŸ‘‹


I'm a M.Sc. Student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

I'm mainly interested in Data Engineering and I'm currently the vice president of the student association Polimi Data Scientists, we organize events with companies to bridge the gap between university students and the data science work market, and we also organize projects and workshops to give students to chance to put their do some hands on data science work.

Here you can take a look at the projects I've done over the years, some of them as part of my academic education, others out of personal interest.
